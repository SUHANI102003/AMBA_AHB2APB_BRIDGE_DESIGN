## ðŸ“– Project Overview  

This project implements an **AHB-to-APB Bridge** in **Verilog HDL**, which connects the **high-performance AHB bus** with the **low-power APB bus** inside a System-on-Chip (SoC).  

- The AHB bus is typically used by **CPUs, DMA, and memory** for fast transactions.  
- The APB bus is used by **peripherals like UART, GPIO, Timers** that donâ€™t need high bandwidth.  
- The **bridge** acts as a translator, handling protocol differences and synchronizing transfers across clock domains.  

It ensures **seamless data transfer** between high-speed and low-speed components, enabling efficient SoC design.
